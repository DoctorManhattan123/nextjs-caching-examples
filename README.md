# Next.js Caching

This repository is to follow along with the following explanation: https://docs.titanom.com/next.js/cache

`caching-api` - holds the api for the random number endpoint:

```ts
cd caching-api
pnpm i
node app.js
```

`caching-example` - hold the example for the app

```ts
cd caching-example
pnpm i
pnpm build && pnpm start // do not do `pnpm dev` as this behaves differently
```
